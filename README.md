# HumanDetectionYolov3

## Intro

This is a project that is concerned with Human Detection using the YOLO algorithm. It is able to detect humans based on their body features, and it counts all humans that
are within the frame. The project is also setup with the flask framework, enabling browser streaming of the camera feed.

## Prerequisites

Before you use the code, you will need to install OpenCV ```pip install opencv-python```.
